# Statistics scripts

Random statistics scripts I made.

### Partial correlation

pcor.py

Requires:
numpy
pandas
scipy

Simple partial correlation implementation. A modification of the one from (here)[https://gist.github.com/fabianp/9396204419c7b638d38f] (which is wrong) that also allows to set what variables you want to control for.
